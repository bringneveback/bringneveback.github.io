                    <p class="futura">Allegedly, Neve Campbell has signed on for the film behind closed doors. The pay dispute was very much real, 
                        but there is word that they have reached an agreement and Neve will appear in the movie. This is all just
                        speculation until a proper announcement is made, but should this be true, it just goes to show how strong the
                        <strong>Scream</strong> fandom is and how important Neve Campbell is to the <strong>Scream</strong> franchise.

                            Paramount, <br>
                            Neve Campbell is Scream. She has been the face of the franchise since 1996. She has had the highest screentime across the entire franchise than any other character. There is no Scream without Sidney, just like how there is no Fast and Furious without Vin Diesel and no Halloween without Jamie Lee Curtis. It was plain as day stated in the last movie that the legacy characters have to be back to make the movie matter. You just can't do Scream without Neve Campbell.
                            <br><br>
                            You've seen the outrage from fans, the show of support of Neve from other celebrities. You know Scream can't work without her because you put her at the forefront of the entire marketing for Scream (2022), despite only having less than 15 minutes of screentime. The trailer was compiled in a way to make it look like Sidney was the lead again, but she was a supporting character. You know this just won't work with Neve, and you know that she is worth a lot more than you offered her.
                            <br><br>
                            Take this as a heartfelt plea from fans, respect Neve from what she has brought to this franchise and what she will continue to bring. Don't destroy Wes Craven's legacy because you aren't realising Neve's true worth. Don't make Scream 6 the last movie when it inevitably doesn't rank well without Neve. Realise what Neve, and Sidney, means to the franchise and what she means to fans. We know you respect the fans, we know the directors respect the fans and love Neve just as much as we do.
                            <br><br>
                            Bring Neve Campbell back!

                            Fans,<br>
                            There has been a lot of abuse being hurled towards the cast and crew of Scream 6, particularly Melissa Barrera, Tyler Gillet and Matt Bettinelli-Olpin.
                            <br><br>
                            But the cast and crew of the film are not to blame for what is happening with Neve. It's the higher-ups at Paramount and Spyglass who are to address for these issues.
                            <br><br>
                            That being said, no abuse should be hurled towards anyone. It's fine to support Neve and petition to bring her back, but harassing anyone related
                            <br><br>
                            to the production is not on and is only likely to do the opposite of what we're trying to achieve. Support Neve peacefully, and do not harass or abuse the cast and crew.
